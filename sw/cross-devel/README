This directory contains sources for pdp11-bkbin, a tool to convert 
pdp-11 a.out files created by BKUNIX dev tools into BK-0010 loadable
.BIN files.


After you have succesfully compiled and installed BKUNIX dev tools,
run make && make install. It should create pdp11-bkbin executable
in /usr/local/bin. The utility is equivalent to strip, except that
it creates .bin files.
